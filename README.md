Washington â€” The 170 million TikTok users in the U.S. could be in for a rude awakening come Sunday if they suddenly find the enormously popular video-sharing app is inaccessible because of a law passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress last year.

TikTok users received an alert Saturday in the app indicating that the company could voluntarily shut it down beginning Sunday.
